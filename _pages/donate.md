[MEMBERSHIP REGISTRATION FORM](https://goo.gl/forms/eDeVcpyOXbugo4bt1)

PLEASE READ THESE CAREFULLY BEFORE BEING A PART OF OUR FAMILY

REGARDING THIS BLOG AND THE FACEBOOK PAGE:-
1. The pictures uploaded in the blog are taken by our team members. You can share them and you can download them. BUT DO NOT UPLOAD THOSE DOWNLOADED PHOTOGRAPHS SEPARATELY. If you do upload them separately then MENTION OUR PAGE OR GIVE CREDIT TO THE PERSON WHO TOOK IT.

2.  Do not use abusive language in the comments. Do not post any kind of pornographic picture or absurd GIF’s in the comment box. You have the right to criticise our work but not by using those methods.

REGARDING MEMBERSHIP:-
1. You can donate a “one time donation” by contacting our collector team. You can contact them by going to our DONATION section.

2. If you want to become a permanent member then please fill up the form given in the link above.

3. If you submit the form then you are considered as a permanent member. In that case the amount entered in the form is expected from you every year. The date of submission of donated money may vary but you will be notified.

4. If you are unable to submit the amount entered then please contact our Team Members (Contacts in the DONATION section)

5. In case of an emergency condition (such as flood, drought or any natural calamity) or a mini project, EVERY PERMANENT MEMBER MUST CONTRIBUTE SOME AMOUNT FROM THEIR ANNUALLY PAYABLE AMOUNT. The rest of the amount will be expected to be submitted during the Annual submission period. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO CONTRIBUTE IN THE EMERGENCY PERIOD THEN YOU MUST NOTIFY THAT TO OUR TEAM.

6. We have just started in our mission of spreading happiness. So we are still not a registered NGO. You will be given a slip as a confirmation of your donation but no registration number (of our KHEYA) will be given to you. And we promise you that your love will be conveyed to those who need it the most but it is not certain if your name will be in any of our Social Media posts.

7. Any member of the society has the right (1) to present & participate the annual governing body meeting actively; (2) to submit suggestion for discussion to the governing body on any matter relating to the society; (3) to pay his subscription in prescribed time; (4) to take part in the election of the governing body.
WE HOPE THAT YOU BECOME A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

THANK YOU.
