## Project Overview

The "Circle of Opportunity" tackles the challenge of limited educational resources for deserving students from low-income families. We achieve this by fostering a unique, community-driven model connecting individual donors, students, and the KHEYA trust. Donors receive personalised gift coupons, fostering a sense of connection with the students they directly support. Students use these coupons alongside detailed applications to request educational materials from the trust.

Target Audience:

- Underprivileged Students: We target academically promising students from low-income families.
- Donors: We seek passionate individuals along with corporate sponsors invested in educational equity.

## Project Goals (SMART)

- Increase Donations by 20% (Year 1): We'll achieve this through personalized gift coupons and targeted social media campaigns.
- Support 100 Students (Year 1): We'll establish a user-friendly application system and efficient review process.
- Improve Student Performance (80%): We'll track GPA or standardized test scores before and after receiving materials.
- Maintain Donor Satisfaction (90%): We'll ensure clear communication and offer feedback opportunities.
- Secure Corporate Sponsorship (Year 1): This will expand program reach and long-term sustainability.

## Project Activities

- Donor Outreach Campaign (Months 1-2): We'll develop engaging materials highlighting the program's impact. Utilize social media platforms relevant to your target donor demographics (e.g., LinkedIn for corporate sponsors). Partner with local businesses for outreach events.
- Gift Coupon Design & Distribution (Month 1): Design and print personalized gift coupons for donors.
- Student Application System (Months 1-2): Develop a user-friendly online system for student applications. Applications will require transcripts, a financial needs assessment, and an essay outlining goals.
- Committee Formation & Review Process (Month 2): Recruit educators and community leaders to review applications based on pre-defined criteria (academic merit and financial need).
- Material Procurement & Partnerships (Ongoing): Secure partnerships with educational material vendors to offer students a wide range of resources at competitive prices.
- Distribution System (Months 1-2): Develop a secure system for distributing materials directly to students' homes or designated schools.
- Student Progress Tracking (Ongoing): Maintain communication with students and track their academic performance after receiving support.

## Sustainability

We want this project to keep going. We'll make sure donors and students have a good experience, and we'll work with companies to keep getting good deals on educational stuff. We'll also look for other ways to get money to keep the project going.
